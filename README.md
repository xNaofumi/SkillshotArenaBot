# SkillshotArenaBot

This is a Discord bot written specifically for my guild. It has some useful commands for managing the server like ban command or mass message deletion command. The main point of this bot is to automate process of managing rating system inside the server. Each member has their own rating statistics based on their games. Bot's goal is to store and send each player's games data and organize rating matchmaking:
